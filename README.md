## **Key Takeaways from Exercise** 
Javascript is similar to the languages that I have used before like Python covered in CMSC 12 and Java covered in CMSC 22. 
It can be quite simple to use and navigate with the help of my background knowledge of the languages I've mentioned 
though it was a tiny bit challenging since it was already a long time ago.
